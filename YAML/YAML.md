<h1 align="center"> YAML </h1>

### YAML: 
It was first called Yet Another MarkUp Langugae but now it is Yaml Ain't MarkUp Language.
### Definition:
Applications written with different technologies or languages which have different *Data Structures* can transfer data to each other using a *Common/ Standerd Format*. YAML, JSON and XML are these formats

It is a Data Serialization Language
 - Data Serialization:
Translation of Object (Code + Data) into stream of bytes that saves the state of this object in a form that is transmittable. Using Serialization, data can be converted into code and code can be converted into data again.

Benifits of YAML:
- Simple and easy to read
- Nice and Strict Syntax
- Most Languages use it
- More powerful when representing complex data

***Note: Any JSON input can be converted to YAML output and vice versa***
